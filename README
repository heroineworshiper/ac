This combines bits from 3 cheap nano misters to make an automated water
sprayer air conditioner.  The transducers & control boards can be taken
out of the gadgets.  Water is pumped to the transducers from an outboard
tank.

The recommended pump is a peristaltic pump.  The transducers have to
point horizontally to let air bubbles escape.

mist.X: 
    firmware which presses all the power buttons on the control boards,
    senses the water level & activates the pump.  Compiles with MPLAB


mist3.FCStd:
    The 3D printed parts to mount 3 bare transducers on an elevated stand.

    cap - transducer covers
    tank - small reservoir for the transducers
    tank roof - houses the water level sensor & allows overflow water to leak out
    inlet - water inlet from the pump
    front - front of tank
    drain - glue to back of tank to direct overflow water
    pivot - glue to drain to bolt the tank on the stand
    stand - vertical part of stand
    base - horizontal part of stand
